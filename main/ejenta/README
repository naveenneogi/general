EjentaParty:
-----------
* EjentaParty class allows one to set:
    the minimum number of contacts each contact should know from the final invites list
    the pairs of contacts that know each other from STDIN accepting these as Integers (numbers only)
* Client can either set these two parameters through the constructor OR by calling explicit Settors
* Clients can then call the getPartyContactList() method to get the final invites list that satisfy
the min contacts requirement. An empty list means we could not come up with a list of contacts that
satisfy the min contacts req.

* As for representing contacts, I have used simple Integers/numeric IDs to denote a contacts since
this guarantees to be unique per contact and also spares us from dealing with strings or any other
complex data types or objects of our own.

* As for the solution design, although there could be many ways to solve this, I have used simple
recursion to start with a full list of contacts first and then recursively chopping the list down
by removing contacts that do not satisy the minKnown criteria on that chopping round.
Recursion ends when we eventually hit a list that itself is less than the min required OR if we could
not chop any contact from that list on that round.

* Also important to note that the solution is NOT thread-safe. Making it so is not a big deal by using
Collections and Synchronized blocks/methods but have been intentionally dropped for the sake of
convenience for now.

* The program tests itself by checking against a hardcoded list of minContacts and list of contact pairs.
It also provides for a way to get inputs from STDIN. The convention used for STDIN is as noted below:
Enter the contact pairs one per line. Enter their numeric IDs only, for eg
	1,5
	1,6
	2,5
	so on, with only one pair per line
If you enter more than one pair per line, only the first pair is considered, rest will be ignored
Enter exit/EXIT when done

* The program prints the given input list and the final invite list as noted below, for eg:
Input/Given Contacts List: {1=[3, 5, 7], 2=[4, 6, 8, 10], 3=[4, 5]}
Party Invites List (an empty list means we could not come up with a list of contacts that knew
atleast 2 other contacts from that list): [1, 3, 5]






ContactsDump:
------------
* I have used a {map of ints -> hashset of ints} to represent each contact and his list of known contacts
* Representing this via ContactsDump class extending HashMap<Integer, HashSet<Integer>>. I could have also
built a bit more complex Contacts class that would represent this info in more involved data structures and
give them gettors and settors, but I chose NOT to, for now.






EjentaPartyHelper:
------------------
* Is a helper class that supports methods to get inputs from STDIN as noted above OR from hardcoded values





EjentaPartyTest:
---------------
* Tests out the functionality by running through the hardcoded set, checking for connections between random
contacts and validating the final invites list by changing the minContacts criteria to 1,2 or 3
